# WIP: [RethinkYourState.net](https://rethinkyourstate.net)

A way to share ideas and information to improve your condition. The idea is to start from scratch and build every function of a state until we find a utopia that works. Then we apply our ideas to our society and spread the word.

## Ideas 
 - using fediverse authentication
 - a Threadbased conversation
 - lots of utopian legislations, to compare
    - scoring of the systems
        - equality
        - health care
        - self-realization of each individual
        - stability, before seizures of power
        - flexability of government 
        - flexability of resources and production
        - ...
    - how real politics look at these ideas, and how far we're away
    - how would the scoring change if something changed in the legislation
 - a realpolitikal view 
 - a happy ChatBot-AI-Assistant, that:
    - removes hate from the network
    - anonymously records a conversation and attaches it to your desired utopian legislation.
    - learns from mistakes and corrections from your fellow human beings and collects this knowledge. Example: "Everyone should own a car", where we only have to compare America with European transport concepts, and see that cities work much better without private car transport. Because the city isnt a hole big parking lot.
